    <P>We asked people what they liked and how they felt  about the stories they shared  about mental health.
       These are the things they told us that mattered to them.</P> 
       
  </div> 
 
      <p>Diversity of age, gender, body shape, ethnicity and physical ability.
A range of activities not just vigorous exercise, yoga or meditation.
Human connection people connecting with those around them is important, but it's also OK to show people being happy on their own.
Realistic everyday clothing, genuine positive expressions, lived-in backgrounds.
Nature including elements of our natural environment but ensuring that it feels accessible.</p><br>
<p>Stereotypes, not everyone practices mindfulness in a forest at sunrise.
Inaccessible activities, showing things which are only accessible to a few and would exclude people from certain backgrounds.Overall,
remember that good mental health is not about achieving
perfection  positive well-being can be achieved in different ways, in different places, by different people</p>
